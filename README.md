2.  Write a second function where you open the Inscriptions.csv data file and load it into a 2D data structure (dictionary of lists, where each column is an inner list). Return this data structure. (5 points)

3. Write a helper function to get a single row of the data, per each data structure. The parameters should include the row number. (5 points)

4. Write a helper function to get a single column of the data, per each data structure. The parameters should include the column name. (5 points)

5. Write a function to test all of your earlier functions, complete with assert statements. (5 points)
